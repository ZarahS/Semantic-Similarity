## Natural Language Processing 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence pertaining to the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. NLP technologies aim to help computers process, understand, and generate human language.

SpaCy is a library for NLP in Python, providing pre-trained models and functionalities for tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. It uses NLP techniques to process human language, making it an NLP library.  To use spaCy, you must first install it and its English language model.

## Install

The spaCy library can be installed by entering the following code into the terminal:

``` 
$ pip3 install spacy
```

To download the english language model, copy the code below:

```
$ python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

## Usage

To run the program, install the components above and enter the following into the terminal:
```
$ python semantic.py
```
